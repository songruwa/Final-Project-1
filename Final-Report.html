<h1>Introdution:</h1>
<p>Since nowadays there are lot of smokers around the world and many policies have been applied to curb the number of smokers, I would like to figure out whether the number of smokers is actually decreased or not. This data is about “Never smoked trend for 1995-2010”. I’ve found the data from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.</p>
</div>
<div id="research-question" class="section level1">
<h1>Research Question:</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Whether non-smokers in each different city become less or not as time goes by</li>
<li>The relationship between the change in the number of smokers and the state.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="description-of-the-data" class="section level1">
<h1>Description of the data:</h1>
<p>While analysing the original data table,I found there are 876 obervations, and 7 variables. In this data set, 56 states (including several islands next to the US) are included. And there is no missing values in the data table, except there are missing values in the location column, but this will not influence my analysis. I deceid to not remove these missing values.</p>

<h1>Data Analsis</h1>
<p>According to the four graphs, I found the number of people who smoke everyday shows a decrease as times goes by. The number of people who smoke someday shows a gradual increase as times goes by.The number of people who never smoke becomes more as time goes by.The number of people who is former smokers, in other words, the people who quit smoking, becomes more as times goes by.</p>

<p>#Conclusion:</p>
<p>Based on the analysis, we can conclude that the number of smokers decreases as time goes by, the number of former smokers increases, and the number of people who never smoke increases. This is possibly due to education, policy, or the taxes on cigerattes.</p>
<p>And these changes also apply to most states, which can be shown from the ggplotly graphs.</p>
